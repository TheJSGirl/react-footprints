### React Redux
#### In this folder I am brushing the concepts of react-redux and it's pattern

Why we use containers and component in react-redux?

In react-redux we usually divideds component in two categories
* Container components (stateful) : In this component we always add bussiness logic. It provides data to presentational component.
* Presentational components (stateless): In this component we always add UI part only how component gonna look.
<hr/>
What are the benefits of using these patterns?

* Better separation of concerns
* Better reusability
* Extract layout components to prevent duplication
